  # Water Level Indicator

   # Introduction

    Water level alarms provide a simple way of detecting and indicating if water is in the overhead tank and in other containers. Most homeowner/households store the water in overhead tanks by using pumps.
    By using the water level indicator we can overcome the overflow of water from tankers. A water level indicator gets information about the level of water in tanks or reservoirs.


   # Components required

    Microcontroller : Arduino Uno microcontroller is used here.

    Comparator : An input of this comparator is provided by a variable resistor that decides when the buzzer is activated for a set water level.

    Water level sensor : This float sensor was used to detect the level of water inside a water tank. Ideally, this sensor should be attached to the top lid of the water tank or liquid tank.When water level increases or decreases, the sensor's attached float moves up and down.

    LCD display : In addition to the Red LED, a buzzer is also provided to visually indicate the threshold level. Both are activated at the same time.

   # What

     Checking the water level in storge areas.

   # When

     When there no one there to control and check the water level in certain area the water level indicator is used.

  #  Where
     
     Where cooling towers are used
     Residential and commercial swimming pools
     Anywhere water levels need to be controlled

  # How

    Water level indicators work by using sensor probes to indicate water levels in a storage tank.
