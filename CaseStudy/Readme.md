  # Water Level Indicator

      Water level alarms provide a simple way of detecting and indicating if water is in the overhead tank and in other containers. Most homeowner/households store the water in overhead tanks by using pumps.
      By using the water level indicator we can overcome the overflow of water from tankers. A water level indicator gets information about the level of water in tanks or reservoirs.

   # Components 

    Microcontroller : Arduino Uno microcontroller is used here.

    Comparator : An input of this comparator is provided by a variable resistor that decides when the buzzer is activated for a set water level.

    Water level sensor : This float sensor was used to detect the level of water inside a water tank. Ideally, this sensor should be attached to the top lid of the water tank or liquid tank.When water level increases or decreases, the sensor's attached float moves up and down.

    LCD display : In addition to the Red LED, a buzzer is also provided to visually indicate the threshold level. Both are activated at the same time.

  # Applications of water level indicator
    
    *The water level indicator is used in hotels, home apartments, commercial complexes, and      factories.
    *The pumps used in the water level indicator are single phase motors, submersible motors, and three phase motors.
    *The two motors, two sumps, and two overhead tanks cannot be controlled with a single circuit. *The pump automatically turns ON/OFF when the water level in the tank is low and high.
    *Fuel level in motor vehicles can also be measured with the liquid level containers found in most companies

  # Advantages of water level indicator

    *Water level indicators are available for a small price in the market. 
    *Anyone can identify the water level by hearing the beep sound. 
    *This allows us to control the water level safely and easily.

  # Alarm Clock

     Digital alarm clocks make a signal or sound at a specific time. Their popularity has increased over the years due to advancements in electronics. The advantage of digital alarm clocks over analogue alarm clocks is that they consume less power.It can be easily set or reset and displays the time in digits.

  # Components
    
     *Microcontroller : It provides an efficient interface for RTCs. It has good computation speed and many pins, and operates at a frequency of 16 MHz.
     *Buzzer : The Buzzer is comprised of switches or sensors connected to a control unit which determines if the condition is satisfied and produces a sound. The Positive and Negative terminals are connected to +5V and the Collector is connected to the Transistor's base.
     *LCD display : It has 2 rows which can produce 16 characters. It uses 1mA of current and can display alphanumeric characters.
